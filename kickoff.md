# Brainstorming

I have been thinking about creating my own investment vehicle for a few days or 
weeks now. I want to limit my risk by having a stable investment balance out 
some higher return (likely higher risk) investments. 

## The idea

To start, put 90% of my funds in the highest yield, low (or no) risk investment 
and 10% in the next highest yielding/risk product. As both pools of money grow, 
roll the excess into a higher yield investment. 

## The Baseline

What are the lowest-risk/highest-yield investments I can make?

### Savings Accounts

For savings, the best you can hope to do is slightly higher than 0.5%. That is 
going to make it tough to get rich quick.
